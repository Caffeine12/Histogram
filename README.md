# Image Processing: Primary Concept Practice #
### Plotting Histogram of false pixels in binary image ###
1. First a RGB image has been read.
2. Then red green blue informations were separated into three different matrices.
3. RGB image has been converted to a binary image.
4. Then false pixel frequency for each row has been calculated.
5. Histogram of the picture was plotted.
